                <p>Hi! I'm Kristina- Half White, Half Filipina. Born and raised in Kansas City, MO. Now living in Los Angeles, CA but still rockin' that midwest charm. Much older than I look, goofier than you'd expect, and sometimes I laugh too loud. Good at keeping others secrets, bad at keeping my own. 
                    
                <p>Some have said that I never let the grass grow too much under my feet. I currently work full time in the day ($$), attend coding school at night (undercover nerd), take spanish class once and week (ay dios), and occasional singing lessons (me me me me). What can I say, I have several passions...</p>

                <p>Once a year I travel for 2-3 weeks in a new country. I started traveling cross country five years ago, and so far I've traveled to 20 countries. I am planning another solo trip for when I graduate my coding bootcamp in November! Yay. </p>
